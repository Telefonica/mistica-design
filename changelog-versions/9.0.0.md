## Migration notes

### Autolayout changes

We've evolved the auto-layout of the components to have the strokes included, which means that the height and width of multiple components in the library will increase the border width x2. In those artboards where the design is not using auto-layout, the spacing between element will be affected (please review those cases

### Button split

We've identified instances of the Button component that are not updating automatically with the release of the libraries. In order to identify those cases quickly in a file, the find feature of Figma (edit/find) can help to spot and select those instances to be swapped for the new ones. The buttons need to be selected and swapped by type, so you'll need to select all the primary instances and swap to `ButtonPrimary` component, all the secondary and swap to `buttonSecondary` and all the button link and swap to `buttonLink`.
