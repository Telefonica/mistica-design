Your proposal should include:

- A detailed description of the proposed change, evolution or new idea.

Other information could help to validate the proposal earlier:

- Research data.
- Examples of current usage
- Examples of where the proposal could solve a problem more efficiently.
- A validated PRD, or confirmation that APIa can serve this information

The discussion is an opportunity to gather feedback from the Mística Design System team and the community.
We will review your proposal and provide feedback to help you refine and improve it. We may also ask for additional information or clarification.

Discussions will be reviewed by the core design team to ensure the standards are met.When reviewed and approved a issue related to the discussion will be created.

## Issues

When the issue is created a new branch will be created by the core team in figma to allow teams to document the new additions in that file

## Specs

### Modifying existing components

The specs are on a branch:

When they are considered finished, they are asked to merge them, putting design core as reviewer of that branch
Design core reviews and if approved it is merged
As soon as something is merged it is considered ready for PR

### New components

A new file is created with the prefix `Draft`

When they are ready, a review is requested
If approved, their prefix is ​​changed to `Ready` and they are ready for PR

Once they are ready, the JIRA tickets for iOS, Android and web are created and referenced in the issue that started the task

### From design to development

The PR's open in the web, iOS, or Android repositories should always link to the official specs file, this document should be approved and tagged as ready for development.
